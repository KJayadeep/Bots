This project utilizes hand gestures detected through a webcam feed to control screen-brightness and volume.
The Webcam detects the distance between Thumb and index finger in real-time using the MediaPipe library and uses screen_brightness_control & pycaw libraries for brightness and volume control.
The left hand controls brightness, while the right hand controls volume.
Visual feedback is provided in real-time through the webcam feed(such as circles and lines) on detected hands.
